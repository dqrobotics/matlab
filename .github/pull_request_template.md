# Code of Conduct

By submitting this pull request, you automatically agree that you've read and accepted the following conditions:

- Anyone wanting to propose a new modification or introduce new functionality should reach out to the team first, as proposed modifications that do not comply with the library's development philosophy and style, do not follow the library's architecture, don't introduce a clear and general benefit to the library other than to the person who proposed the modification will likely be rejected with no further discussion.
- Support for DQ Robotics is given voluntarily and it's not the developers' role to educate and/or convince anyone of their vision.
- Any possible response and its timeliness will be based on the relevance, accuracy, and politeness of a request and the following discussion.
- You are familiar with the [development workflow](https://github.com/dqrobotics/matlab/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
